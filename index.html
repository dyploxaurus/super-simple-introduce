                <p>&#x1F343;<b>Video Games!</b> I really like playing video games! since childhood I've been playing games. starting from Gameboy, Nintendo DS, PSP, PlayStation, Wii, Mobile Game and PC Game. but for now, I mostly play PC games, especially Valorant, GTA V, SCUM, Stardew Valley, CS:GO, Call of Duty, and many more. contact me if you want to play together!</p>
                
                <p>&#x1F343;<b>Cooking, </b>I am very happy to try new recipes from various types of food. Starting from Japanese, Korean, Chinese and even western food. cz for me cooking is very therapeutic. when I'm overwhelmed with all my tasks, I calm myself by cooking.</p>
            
                <p>&#x1F343;<b>Photography and Video Editing </b>I really like holding the camera and taking pictures. because for me, taking a picture is not just taking the picture, but capturing the moment that happened at that time to be remembered. then I also like to edit videos. even by developing my hobby, I got a job that matches my passion and hobby. very grateful!</p>
